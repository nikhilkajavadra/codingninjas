Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
Note: Try finding out a function on the internet to do so


CODE:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Driver Code
int main() {
  int basic;
  char grade;
  cin >> basic;
  cin >> grade;

  int allowance;
  double hra, da, pf;

  hra = 0.2 * basic;
  da = 0.5 * basic;
  pf = 0.11 * basic;

  // Condition to compute the
  // allowance for the person
  if (grade == 'A') {
    allowance = 1700;
  } else if (grade == 'B') {
    allowance = 1500;
  } else {
    allowance = 1300;
  }

  int gross;

  // Calculate gross salary
  gross = round(basic + hra + da + allowance - pf);
  cout << gross;
  return 0;
}
